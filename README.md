INSTRUCTION SET ARCHITECTURE
============================

The processor supports 15 instruction types across three formats:

R-Type Instructions (Register Format)
--------------------------------------
Instruction         | Opcode | Operation           | Description
--------------------|--------|---------------------|------------------
add Rd, Rs, Rt      | 0000   | Rd = Rs + Rt        | Addition
sll Rd, Rs, shamt   | 0001   | Rd = Rs << shamt    | Shift Left Logical
srl Rd, Rs, shamt   | 0010   | Rd = Rs >> shamt    | Shift Right Logical
or Rd, Rs, Rt       | 0011   | Rd = Rs | Rt        | Bitwise OR
and Rd, Rs, Rt      | 0100   | Rd = Rs & Rt        | Bitwise AND
mul Rs, Rt          | 1010   | [Hi,Lo] = Rs × Rt   | Multiplication
mflo Rd             | 1011   | Rd = Lo             | Move from Lo
mfhi Rd             | 1100   | Rd = Hi             | Move from Hi

beq Rd, Rs, Label     | 1011   | PC = PC + address (if Rd==Rs)| Branch if Equal

EXECUTION FLOW
==============

1. Fetch: PC points to instruction address in ROM

3. Execute: ALU performs the specified operation
4. Memory Access: Load/store operations access data memory
5. Write Back: Results written to destination registers
6. PC Update: Program counter incremented or updated based on instruction type

STATUS REGISTER (SR)
====================

The Status Register contains important flags updated during operations:

Bit Position | Flag     | Description
-------------|----------|------------------------
0            | Overflow | Set when arithmetic overflow occurs
1            | Carry    | Set when carry is generated
2            | Negative | Set when result is negative
3            | Zero     | Set when result is zero
